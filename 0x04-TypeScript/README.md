Typescript
TypeScript is a programming language that helps developers write better and safer JavaScript code. It adds a layer of checking to catch mistakes early, like a safety net. With TypeScript, you can define the types of data your code uses, making it clearer and easier to understand. This helps prevent bugs and makes it more predictable how your code will behave. In a nutshell, TypeScript makes coding in JavaScript more reliable and less error-prone.
